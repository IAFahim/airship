Hi,

I am a professional bug bounty hunter and ethical hacker with extensive experience in cybersecurity. During my recent assessments, I discovered vulnerabilities within your infrastructure that could potentially compromise your GitHub repositories and more.

I believe in responsible disclosure and am committed to helping organizations like yours improve their security posture. I would be happy to provide further details on the vulnerability along with recommendations for remediation.

Please feel free to reach out to me at bug.bbounty@outlook.com so we can discuss this matter further in a secure and confidential manner.

Thanks,
